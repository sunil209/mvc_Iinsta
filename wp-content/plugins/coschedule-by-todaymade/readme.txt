CoSchedule will update that WordPress data as you direct, but the data always remains in WordPress. Social messages, tasks, comments, team members, and other data you create in CoSchedule will be stored on CoSchedule's servers, and never in WordPress.

##### How do I get CoSchedule?

After you [sign up for an account at CoSchedule](https://coschedule.com/signup), you can connect your WordPress blog to your CoSchedule account.
